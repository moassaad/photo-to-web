                    The London Evening Standant reports on Kevin O'Sullivan work to help Geoff Lee fight for legal justice following his wifter's death following a cycle accident,
                    <br><br>
                    Cycle Legal are still campaigning for justice in the way of an apology and changes to prevent this from happening ever again. The case was not about the claim, even though some financus payment has been awarded, but purely about implementing a change
                    <br><br>
                    Me Lee and solicitar Kevin O'Sullivan, whose new firm Cycle Legal specialises in helping cyclists and their families, brought an action against the insumers of New Southgate builders Fitzgerald & Burke Aher an insensitive first offer, a higher second amount was made to settle the case
                    <br><br>
                    "Narvely I was hoping to get the driver back into a courtroom and get the verdict i didn't get with a jury on the balance of probabilities," Mr Lee said
                    <br><br>
                    "I never wanted anyone to go to prison, I never wanted loads of cash. I just wanted an acknowledgement of the tragedy It seemed to me that everybody was trying to cover their own backsides, in court, felt all the sympathy was with the driver of the lorry"
                    <br><br>
                    Mr O'Sullivan said: "What's more important to the fairslies in these situations is some recognition of their loss, and some action from the lomy company in trying to prevent another family going through the same experience"
                    <br>
                    "Fitzgerald & Burke have thus far refused to communicate with us about any ways they could improve driver training tir safer lony design, and our fight to achieve this change goes on."
